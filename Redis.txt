Redis is an open-source, in-memory data structure store used as a database,
 cache, and message broker.

It is a NoSQL advanced key-value data store, and is often referred to as a data structure server because its keys contain strings, 
hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, bitmaps, and hyperloglogs. Redisâ€™ read and write operations are very fast because it stores data in memory.
Data can also be stored on the disk or written back to the memory.
Since Redis stores its data in memory, it is most commonly used as a cache.

Speed: Redis is very fast. It can perform 110,000 SETs per second and 81,000 GETs per second.
Supports rich data types: Redis supports most of the data types, such as list, set, sorted set, and hashes. This gives you a ton of flexibility
Operations are atomic: This ensures that if two clients access data concurrently, the Redis server will receive an updated value.
Versatile uses: Redis can be used for caching, messaging-queues, and short-lived data such as web application sessions.
Easy to set up: Redis is easy to configure

-> Redis can be used as message broker like kafka and rabiitmq.
